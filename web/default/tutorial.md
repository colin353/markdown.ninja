# Tutorial

Keep this document around, so you can refer back to how this site works!

### Visiting your webpage

Your webpage is at something like: `yourdomain.markdown.ninja`. If you click on the circular icon in the top right of the screen, you can click on your domain to open it in a new tab.

### Creating a new page

Click the button in the file browser called "+ new page". You can rename the page by right-clicking (or long tapping on mobile) and selecting "rename".

### Your index page

Make sure you have a page called `index.md`. If you rename the page to something else, your site won't load properly.

### Uploading files

If you upload a file called `filename.png`, it's accessible via a url like this:

`http://yourdomain.markdown.ninja/files/filename.ext`

You can only upload 100 MB worth of files, total, so don't go crazy.

### Linking

Here's a link [to another page](/index.md)

And here's a link [to a file](/files/file.txt)

### Formatting tips

- You can make a bullet list
- pretty easily, just
- like this

You can do *italic* and **bold** text.

> It's easy to do block quotes, as well
> if you want to include a quotation of
> some kind.

And you can make horizontal lines like so:
___

### Images

Here's how you can insert an image:

![katana](http://markdown.ninja/img/katana.png)

Or, you can use HTML, like this:

<img width=64 src="http://markdown.ninja/img/katana.svg" />

Or, if you want to link to an image on your domain, you can do this (it won't work unless you upload a file with that filename, though)

![your picture](/files/image.png)
